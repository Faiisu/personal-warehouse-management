# Personal Stock Management

Personal Stock Management is a small full‑stack warehouse tracker that lets registered users manage multiple stock locations, categories, and products. The frontend is a React (Vite) single‑page app, while the backend is a Go Fiber API backed by MongoDB. Docker assets are included for containerized deployments.

## Features

- Email/password authentication with hashed credentials, local session caching, and admin/dashboard routes.
- Warehouse inventory flows: create/delete stocks, browse per-user warehouses, drill into products by stock, and manage categories tied to a stock.
- Product management APIs to create, update, delete, and list stock items with quantities and units.
- Category management APIs with cascading clean-up for related products.
- Auto-generated Swagger docs (`/swagger/index.html`) for all public HTTP endpoints.
- Dockerfiles and compose setup for building both the Go API and the React + Nginx static site.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, CSS modules, localStorage session cache.
- **Backend:** Go 1.24, Fiber v2, MongoDB Go driver, bcrypt auth, Swagger.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, docker-compose, Nginx static hosting.

## Prerequisites

- Go **1.24+**
- Node.js **18+** (for React 19 + Vite)
- npm **10+**
- MongoDB instance (local or managed)
- Docker 24+ (optional, for containerized workflows)

## Backend (Go Fiber API)

```bash
cd backend
go mod download
go run .
```

Before running, create or edit `backend/.env` (loaded by `github.com/joho/godotenv`) or export the variables yourself:

| Variable | Required | Description | Default |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MONGO_URL` | ✅ | MongoDB connection string with credentials. | – |
| `MONGO_DB_NAME` | ❌ | Database name for all collections. | `event_hub` |

The API serves on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Swagger docs are available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`.

## Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # serves on http://localhost:5173
```

Vite expects a backend origin configured in `frontend/.env` (anything starting with `VITE_` is exposed to the client):

```ini
VITE_BACKEND_IP=http://localhost:8080
```

Build for production with `npm run build`, preview with `npm run preview`

## Docker & Deployment

The `deploy/docker-compose.yml` file builds both services. From the repo root:

```bash
cd deploy
docker compose up --build
```

Create or edit `deploy/.env` to define Mongo credentials, host ports, and build-time overrides before starting the stack.

Key environment values consumed by the compose stack:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Host port mapped to Fiber’s `:8080`. | `8080` |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Host port mapped to Nginx `:80`. | `3000` |
| `FRONTEND_BACKEND_IP` | Backend URL baked into the frontend image. | `localhost:3000` |
| `MONGO_URL` / `MONGO_DB_NAME` | Same as dev setup. | `mongodb://mongo:27017` / `personal_stock_manage` |

> **Note:** The compose file assumes a reachable MongoDB instance referenced by `MONGO_URL`. Add a `mongo` service or point to an external cluster before running `docker compose up`.

## API Surface
